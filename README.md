# Linear-Regression-
Hello world! I am Siddharth, and this is my code for linear regression using the gradient descent optimisation technique. 
It is definitely not a very efficient way to write it, as its my first machine learning program.
It took me a LOT of effort to get this correct; if I remember correctly I have written all the code from start with a new approach 
atleast 8 times. 

The program is written in python. The methods and variables have meaningful names, but comments are nnot provided. I am just too happy right now
to do all that boring stuff. 

To run the code, you need to have numpy installed in your PC. If it is not there, just open command prompt and type 'pip install numpy'
and that should do it. After that, to run the program, open a text-editor and copy and paste the code. Save the file as a '.py' file.
Now come back to command prompt and type 'python ' followed by the name of your saved file, along with the '.py' part. 
The output will be two values, one of M and one of B, which can be used to plot a staright line through the data(in an equation 
of the format y=mx+b). Also make sure you have the latest 3.x version of python installed on your PC, which can be done from the python
website. 


I am really really so glad this code worked. Persistence helped me overcome my stupidity. I am learning, this was the first step, and 
I am so freaking excited about the universe that lies ahead of me.
